My first node command application using yargs and inquirer. The app computes how old a given person is based on the year of birth provided and stores the output on a given file.

## Getting Started
First, install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the App:

```bash
chmod +x index.js
./index.js -n John -y 1995 -f how-old-is-jonh-this-year.txt
```
